# Project REST API Anime Watchlist

## Introducing
Anime Watchlist API is a REST API designed to help users manage and track the anime they want to watch. This API provides various features such as watchlist management, anime reviews, and history search.  This project will allow users to search for animes, view detailed information about them, and create a watchlist for tracking animes they want to watch. The service will fetch anime data from a third-party API Jikan API and provide a set of basic features for managing and browsing animes.
